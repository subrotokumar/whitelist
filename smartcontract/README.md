This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
